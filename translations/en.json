    "content": "<p>This is the CESSDA Data Catalogue (CDC) version 3.2.0, released on 2022-12-08. It contains descriptions of the more than 40,000 data collections held by CESSDA’s Service Providers (SPs). Datasets come from over 20 European countries. It is a one-stop shop for searching and finding European social science data. The data described may be quantitative, qualitative or mixed-modes data, cross-sectional or longitudinal, recently collected or historical data. The metadata (study descriptions) are in whatever language they were provided by the organisations producing the metadata. Some publishers provide study descriptions both in English and in the local language, some only in either English or in the local language. Currently, about 75%% of study descriptions are available in English.</p><p>The <a href=\"/documentation/\">User Guide</a> presents an overview of how to use the data catalogue for searching, including basic search and applying filters as well as advanced search.</p><p>The CDC is a portal for discovering data. Detailed dataset descriptions are provided. For information and procedures to access data, there is a link [“Access data”] from each study to the study information on the website of the data provider (Publisher). Check the information there to see what access conditions apply to data created in that particular study.</p><p>There is also an <a href=\"https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/\">OAI-PMH compliant endpoint</a>, so that data aggregators can easily harvest the entire contents of the data catalogue. Record identifiers are unified with those used in the User Interface. It is located at <a href=\"https://datacatalogue.cessda.eu/oai-pmh/v0/oai?verb=Identify\"> https://datacatalogue.cessda.eu/oai-pmh/v0/oai</a>.</p><p>There is also a search API. Documentation is available at the <a href=\"https://api.tech.cessda.eu/\">public REST APIs for CESSDA Services</a> page.</p><h3>Changes since the last version</h3><ul><li>Add a \"Not Found\" page if a path that is not either /, /about or /detail is requested.</li><li>Add universe descriptions to the study detail page.</li><li>Add related publications to the study detail page.</li><li>Make the search filters \"float\", keeping them onscreen when the search page is scrolled.</li><li>Default to only displaying 12 keywords, add a button to show all keywords.</li><li>Use AND for the search API, reflecting the default behaviour of the user interface.</li><li>Fix the search API returning undefined for the ResultsCount.available field. This was due to Elasticsearch 7 changing the way the total results were returned.</li></ul>"
